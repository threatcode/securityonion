    maxdirectoryfiles:
      description: By default, Stenographer limits the number of files in the pcap directory to 30000 to avoid limitations with the ext3 filesystem. However, if you're using the ext4 or xfs filesystems, then it is safe to increase this value. So if you have a large amount of storage and find that you only have 3 weeks worth of PCAP on disk while still having plenty of free space, then you may want to increase this default setting.

    diskfreepercentage:
      description: Stenographer will purge old PCAP on a regular basis to keep the disk free percentage at this level. If you have a distributed deployment with dedicated forward nodes, then the default value of 10 should be reasonable since Stenographer should be the main consumer of disk space in the /nsm partition. However, if you have systems that run both Stenographer and Elasticsearch at the same time (like eval and standalone installations), then youâ€™ll want to make sure that this value is no lower than 21 so that you avoid Elasticsearch hitting its watermark setting at 80% disk usage. If you have an older standalone installation, then you may need to manually change this value to 21.
